## Introduction

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduces several new features and syntactical improvements that make JavaScript more powerful and easier to work with. This module covers the essential aspects of ES6, including new syntax, operators, and object-oriented programming features.

## Topics Covered

1. **Variable Declarations**: `let` and `const`
2. **Arrow Functions**: Shorter syntax for writing functions
3. **Template Literals**: Enhanced string operations
4. **Destructuring**: Easy extraction of values from arrays and objects
5. **Spread and Rest Operators**: Simplifying function arguments and array/object operations
6. **Classes**: Object-oriented programming with class syntax
7. **Modules**: Importing and exporting code between files
8. **Promises**: Handling asynchronous operations
9. **Iterators and Generators**: Advanced iteration mechanisms
